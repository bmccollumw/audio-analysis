# ðŸŽ§ Audio Analysis with Python + Jupyter

This project is a hands-on exploration of audio analysis using Python. It focuses on extracting BPM (tempo), visualizing waveforms, and preparing audio files for deeper insights â€” like beat detection or key recognition.

Built in a Jupyter notebook, this was my way of learning how to interact with audio programmatically, using tools that professionals in music tech, data science, and web apps often rely on.

## What This Project Does

- Loads `.mp3` or `.wav` audio files
- Extracts tempo (BPM) using `librosa`
- Visualizes waveforms and tempograms using `matplotlib`
- Creates a clean, reusable setup in Jupyter for audio experiments

---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/)
- [librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/main/index.html) â€” for audio analysis
- `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas` â€” for visuals & data handling
